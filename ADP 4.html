        <h4><font color="White">Musk Foundation</font></h4>

        <p2><font color="white">Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[265][266] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and "safe artificial intelligence"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[267]

            As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's nonprofit Big Green.[268] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[269] which was a nonprofit at the time.[270] The Foundation also allocated $100 million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas.[271]
            
            In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[272] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[273]
            
            Vox said in February 2021, "the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[269] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[268] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[274] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to nonprofits that year.[275] Reporting by The New York Times found that in 2022, the Musk Foundation gave away $230 million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status, and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundation's funds went to causes connected to Musk, his family, or his businesses.[276]

                In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vacuum tube train and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[277] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[278] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[279] The document scoped out the technology and<br> outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco<br> Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[280] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop<br> travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[281]
                
                In 2015, Musk announced a design competition for<br> students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop<br> pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, <br>with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[282] In July 2017, Musk said that he had received "verbal government approval" to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore.[283] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website in 2021.[284] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[285]
                
                Biographer Ashlee Vance noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would "make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train" proposal current in California at the time and consider more "creative" ideas.[286]
